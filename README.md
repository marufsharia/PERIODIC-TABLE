================================PERIODIC-TABLE--Pl2-Project============================
‘FORMULA DIARY (PERIODIC TABLE)’ is constructed based on periodic table of chemistry. 
Mainly, this is a combination of atom and details of it. 
Molecules details can be found by search by atom name or atomic number.

This is a simple PERIODIC-TABLE which I was made it using Cpp (C++).It was my class assignment.
